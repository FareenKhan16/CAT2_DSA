# Q2: Arrays and Linked Lists

The main differnces lie in  allocating memory, their performance characteristics, and how they handle insertion and deletion operations.

**1. Memory Allocation***

Arrays:
  > Memory is allocated contiguously.

  > The size of an array is fixed at the time of creation
Linked Lists:
  > Memory is allocated dynamically for each node.
  > elements are stored separately in memory and linked using pointers. 
  > Nodes can be scattered throughout memory, with each node containing a pointer to the next node.

**2. Performance**

Arrays:
 > Accesing an element is fast
 > Provides constant time O(1) access to elements using an index.
 > Indexes allow direct access 

Linked Lists:
 > Accesing an element is slower
 >  Requires traversal from the head to the desired node, resulting in O(n).

**3. Insertion/Deletion**
Arrays:
 > Slow 
 > Inserting or deleting elements in the middle requires shifting , leading to a worst-case performance of O(n).

 > Insertion: Adding an element in the middle involves shifting elements to accommodate the new value.
 > Deletion: Removing an element also requires shifting elements to fill the gap.
 > These operations are less efficient compared to linked lists when modifications are required.
   

Linked Lists:
 >Fast (O(1) or O(n))
 > nodes can be inserted/deleted without shifting elements.
 > Generally more efficient for operations at the beginning.

 > Insertion: Can be performed at the beginning O(1) if you have a pointer to the head.
 > Inserting at other positions requires locating the previous node, which is O(n) in the worst case.

 > Deletion: Removing the first node is O(1).
 > Deleting a node from the middle or end also requires finding the previous node, so it might take O(n) time.
