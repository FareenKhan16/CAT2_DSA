# Q1:  Big O Notation in Algorithm Analysis

Big O notation describes the upper bound of an algorithm's time complexity. It helps us understand how an algorithm scales and performs as the input grows.

# Examples & Key Rules 

**1. Constant Time Operations.**
    >Accessing an element in an array takes the same time, without the size of array mattering.No matter how large the  array is, accessing one element is always O(1)
 >Example:
  int getElement(int arr[], int index) {
    return arr[index]; 
}


**2. Ignore constants**
      >Coefficients and lower order terms don’t matter because they have little effect on large inputs.
>Example:
    If an algorithm takes O(2n), we simplify it to O(n).
    If an algorithm runs in O(n + 5), we simplify it to O(n).

> for (int i = 0; i < 2 * n; i++) {  // Runs 2n times, but we drop the 2
    System.out.println(i); 
}



**3. Focus on a dominant term**
      > When multiple terms exist, only the one with the highest growth rate determines the complexity.
   > Example:
      If an algorithm runs in O(n² + n), we simplify it to O(n²) because n² grows much faster than n.

   **4.  Logarithmic Growth**
       > Algorithims that divide the problem into smaller parts like binary search, run in O(log n) complexity
   > Example:
    Finding an element in a sorted array using binary search is O(log n).

**5. Drop Non-Dominant Terms**
        > For combined complexities, when multiple terms exist. Keep only the term that grows the fastest and highest term
   > Example:
     O(n² + n + log n) simplifies to O(n²) because n² dominates the growth.
